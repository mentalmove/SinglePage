        Instead of displaying the the section's position, it is stored
        as a property of the respective section.
        <br>
        This is possible because
        HTML elements can be seen as normal objects.
        <br>
        <pre>on_scroll()</pre>
        will be called every time the user scrolls;
        that is much more information than necessary.
        <br>
        Therefore, the function stops if the difference between
        the actual and the last recognised scroll position
        is less than <code>THRESHOLD</code>.
        <br>
        <pre>compare_sections(down)</pre>
        iterates through the sections, starting with the latest.
        Reverse iteration is necessary - when writing
        <pre>for ( var i = 0; i < sections.length; i++ )</pre>
        instead of
        <pre>for ( var i = (sections.length - 1); i >= 0; i-- )</pre>
        the loop would always stop at the first section.
        <br><br>
        Using the same method for scrolling up would not lead to
        a user friendly result; this can be easily checked by replacing
        <pre>compare_sections( (pageYOffset - scroll_y) > 0 );</pre>
        with
        <pre>compare_sections( 1 );</pre>
        for testing purpose - an already reached section would be lost
        by scrolling only a few pixels upwards.
