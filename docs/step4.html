        It is an immanent property of this type of application
        that the page holds more content than the window can display at once.
        <br>
        For latency reasons, initially invisible parts
        should not be rendered immediately.
        <br><br>
        To simplify things, content shall be completely generated
        (not loaded), and the logic when to show it
        shall be reduced to
        <i>All content at once after closing the overlay</i>.
        <br><br>
        The amount of sections shall be limited by
        <tt>Array</tt> <code>pages</code>
        <br>
        which also defines the respective sections' content
        (it will hold the URLs to load later).
        <br><br>
        Sections are created using
        <pre>document.createElement("div")</pre>
        and then appended using the command
        <pre>appendChild()</pre>
        <br>
        Previously defined CSS classes are used so that only the properties that differ,
        <br>
        <code>backgroundColor</code> and <code>innerHTML</code>,
        <br>
        must be mentioned separately.
