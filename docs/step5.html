        Some changes, enabling the application to react on problems
        potentially occuring in real life.
        <br><br>
        The page is no longer dependent of successfully loading
        the explanation:
        <pre>fallback = setTimeout(load_pages, 3001, 0);</pre>
        invokes content generation even if loading the explanation fails;
        if it succeeds during 3 seconds,
        <pre>clearTimeout(fallback);</pre>
        will delete the timeout.
        <br><br>
        AJAX will be handled more generic:
        <pre>load_content(url, element, callback_function);</pre>
        will treat internet address [<i>url</i>], explanation content zone [<i>element</i>] and success action [<i>callback_function</i>]
        as parameters to make it reusable for potential other AJAX calls.
        <br>
        Loading will only be seen as successful if <b><i>meta</i></b> - tags
        can be found (displaying <b>404</b> messages usually is unwanted).
        <br><br>
        Content generation is only a simulation of content loading,
        and content loading can fail.
        Therefore, every section to fill is observed by
        <pre>section_content.observer = new MutationObserver(dom_changed);</pre>
        <br>
        As long as no change is detected, the next section's generation will not be invoked.
        <br>
        This can be checked easily by changing the <code>pages</code> - Array to
        <pre>var pages = [ "Part 1", "", "Part 3", "Part 4", "Part 5" ];</pre>
        for testing purpose.
        <br><br>
        Finally, one of the first three sections
        will be expanded with dummy content
        to demonstrate the following sections will move.
