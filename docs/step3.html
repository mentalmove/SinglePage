        Since handling of the overlay
        is not the main purpose of this project,
        explanations are outsourced and loaded using AJAX
        (we will need this technique later).
        <br><br>
        The bare minimum of validation is used,
        but this should be arguable when loading
        well-known files from the same domain.
        <br><br>
        Initially, the overlay section is hidden;
        it appears after successful load.
