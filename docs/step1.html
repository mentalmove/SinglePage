        Step 1 does not use Javascript at all -
        it can be seen as preparation for the following.
        <br><br><br>
        The overlay holding the explanation is not part of the excercise;
        the technique used here is known as 'checkbox hack'.
        To prevent caching when the page is reloaded,
        attibute
        <b><i>autocomplete="off"</i></b>
        is used outside a
        <b><i>form</i></b> - tag;
        this leads (although working) to invalid HTML
        and will be corrected in one of the next steps.
        <br><br>
        To hide the overlay permanently for own experiments,
        the <b><i>input</i></b> - tag can be replaced by
        <br><br>
        <pre>&lt;input type="checkbox" class="hackbox close_explanation" autocomplete="off" id="close_explanation" checked&gt;</pre>
        The page holds three almost equal
        <b><i>div</i></b> - tags with a <code>min-height</code> of <code>100%</code>;
        to make this having an effect, the parent element also needs a style property <code>height</code>
        (a consequence of prototypal behaviour: when no height is mentioned,
        obviously a non-zero height will be displayed while the property is still undefined).
        <br><br>
        Property <code>position</code> is set to <code>relative</code>; that enables inner elements
        to use the actual <b><i>div</i></b> as anchor.
        <br><br>
        Please notice the inner <b><i>div</i></b> having property <code>padding-top</code> at <code>25%</code>
        (not <code>50%</code>, what would seem more intuitive).
