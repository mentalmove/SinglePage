        It is an immanent property of this type of application
        that the page holds more content than the window can display at once.
        For latency reasons, initially invisible parts
        should not be rendered immediately.
        <br>
        To simplify things, content shall be completely generated
        (not loaded), and the logic when to show it
        shall be reduced to
        <i>All content at once after closing the overlay</i>.
        <br><br>
        The amount of sections shall be limited by
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: 0.8em; padding-left: 24px">Array</span> <tt style="font-size: 0.8em">pages</tt>
        <br>
        which also defines the respective sections' content
        (it will hold the URLs to load later).
        <br><br>
        Sections are created using
        <br>
        <tt style="font-size: 0.8em; padding-left: 24px">document.createElement("div")</tt>
        <br>
        and then appended using the command
        <br>
        <tt style="font-size: 0.8em; padding-left: 24px">appendChild()</tt>
        <br><br>
        Previously defined CSS classes are used so that only the properties that differ
        <br>
        <span style="padding-left: 24px">i.e.</span> <tt style="font-size: 0.8em">backgroundColor</tt> and <tt style="font-size: 0.8em">innerHTML</tt>
        <br>
        must be mentioned separately.
