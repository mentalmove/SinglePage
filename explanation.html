        Since handling of the overlay
        is not the main purpose of this project,
        explanations are outsourced and loaded using AJAX
        (we will need this technique later).

        The bare minimum of validation is used,
        but this should be arguable when loading
        well-known files from the same domain.

        Initially, the overlay section is hidden;
        it appears after successful load.
